# GRAINMOTHER

A Multi-Effect Audio Engine based on the BELA Platform

Grainmother is a customizable multi-effect audio engine built on the [**BELA**](https://bela.io) platform. It’s designed for musicians and sound designers who want to create unique sounds without relying on external software. The project combines granular synthesis, reverb, and ring modulation into a single device controlled hands-on, rather than through traditional pedal interfaces.

The goal of Grainmother is to provide a flexible, standalone effects processor optimized for live performances. Leveraging BELA’s real-time audio processing capabilities and a custom hardware interface, it offers intuitive controls for creative experimentation.

This project is fully open-source, with all code and schematics available for those interested in exploring or building upon the device.

## Features

Grainmother features three distinct audio effects, each designed to inspire creativity and provide unique sound-shaping capabilities. 

The Ring Modulator combines the input signal with a carrier signal, producing complex textures through advanced modulation types such as diode-based, transistor-based, and hybrid approaches. With additional features like oversampling, bit crushing, and noise modulation are available. It offers fine control over parameters like tune, depth, waveform, and saturation.

The Granulator breaks audio into short grains to create lush textures, time-stretching, and pitch-shifting effects. Grains can be randomized in properties such as panning and length while a delay, a dynamic feedback and filtering options allow for intricate sound design. Its intuitive control set makes it versatile for creating anything from subtle enhancements to fragmented, evolving soundscapes.

The Reverb provides a rich spatial effect, combining early reflections with a late reverberation algorithm inspired by Schroeder and Moorer. With selectable types like Church, Digital Vintage, Seasick, and Room, users can craft immersive spaces and finely adjust decay, damping, and diffusion to match their desired tone.
